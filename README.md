## Code Practice and Examples

[Exercism.io Fortran course track (TBD)](http://exercism.io/languages/fortran)

- From the [github page](https://github.com/exercism/fortran) you can see that they have a fortran track available with some issues posted from 2018, but it looks like it might not be live yet?

[Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)

- This site has a bunch of example solutions for many tasks/problems in a variety of languages including [Fortran](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Fortran).

## Compilers

[GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran)](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/)

- Part of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
